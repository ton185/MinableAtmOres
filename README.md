# MinableAtmOres
Allows quarries and fakeplayers to mine AllTheModium ores

## What?
AllTheModium disabled the ability for fake players to mine their ores. This mod brings that ability back.

Note: They register their blocks with a hardness of -1. This means its technically unbreakable, but they handle some events to fix that for players. To make this work for machines, I had to set the hardness to a different value (100 if you're wondering).

## How?
Mixins

**If you want me to port this mod to another version of forge then make an issue here.**
